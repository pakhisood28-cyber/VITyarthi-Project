# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions need an efficient way to manage student grades and generate performance reports. Manual grade tracking is time-consuming and prone to errors. Teachers need a simple, reliable system to record grades, calculate averages, and identify student performance trends.

## Scope of the Project
The Student Grade Management System provides:
- Digital storage of student information
- Systematic grade recording across multiple subjects
- Automatic calculation of averages and statistics
- Quick generation of individual and class reports
- Data persistence for long-term record keeping

**In Scope:**
- Student CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Grade management for multiple subjects
- Statistical calculations (average, highest, lowest)
- File-based data storage
- Console-based user interface

**Out of Scope:**
- Web or mobile interface
- Multi-user authentication
- Advanced analytics or ML predictions
- Integration with external systems

## Target Users
- **Primary Users**: Teachers and educators in small to medium-sized classrooms
- **Secondary Users**: School administrators for record keeping
- **Use Case**: Managing grades for a class of 20-50 students across 5-10 subjects

## High-Level Features

- Identify top performers

### 4. Data Persistence
- Save all data to text files
- Load existing data on application startup
- Maintain data integrity across sessions
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

### 5. Error Handling & Validation
- Input validation for all user entries
- Graceful error messages
- Prevention of duplicate student IDs
- Handling of file I/O exceptions
